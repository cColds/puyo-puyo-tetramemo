## What I learned

- useEffect to set a timer on a dependency, e.g., currentScore or bestScore
- useRef to target the element and add/remove classes to animate it
- forwardRef to pass the parent ref down to a child component
- Use a variable to update the current state and pass it to multiple functions/hooks in one render
